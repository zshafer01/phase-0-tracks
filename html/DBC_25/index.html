<h1>Wine and Dine as Milwaukeeans Do!</h1>

<h2>This page is to boast about the beer and food industry in Milwaukee, WI</h2>

<p>One very interesting this about Milwaukee, is that we have what is known as a traveling beer garden. 
These beer gardens are run by Sprecher Brewery, and rotate throughout the Milwaukee County Public Parks. 
</p>
<p> For your pleasure I have added below the link to the Beer Garden's schedule for the upcoming 2017 Summer season!</p>

<p>For your reference I have also added a table below outlining the dates and parks in which the Sprecher Beer Garden will be attending.</p>
