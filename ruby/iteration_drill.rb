# 1. Iterate through the zombie_apocalypse_supplies array,
# printing each item in the array separated by an asterisk
# ----

# 2. In order to keep yourself organized, sort your zombie_apocalypse_supplies
# in alphabetical order. Do not use any special built-in methods.
# ----

# 3. Create a method to see if a particular item (string) is in the
# zombie_apocalypse_supplies. Do not use any special built-in methods.
# For instance: are boots in your list of supplies?
# ----

# 4. You can't carry too many things, you've only got room in your pack for 5.
# Remove items in your zombie_apocalypse_supplies in any way you'd like,
# leaving only 5. Do not use any special built-in methods.
# ----

# 5. You found another survivor! This means you can combine your supplies.
# Create a new combined supplies list out of your zombie_apocalypse_supplies
# and their supplies below. You should get rid of any duplicate items.
# Find the built-in method that helps you accomplish this in the Ruby
# documentation for Arrays.

# Hash Drills

  "Passenger Pigeon" => 1914,
  "West African Black Rhinoceros" => 2011,

}

# 1. Iterate through extinct_animals hash, printing each key/value pair
# with a dash in between the key and value, and an asterisk between each pair.
# ----

# 2. Keep only animals in extinct_animals if they were extinct before
# the year 2000. Do not use any special built-in methods.
# ----

# 3. Our calculations were completely off, turns out all of those animals went
# extinct 3 years before the date provided. Update the values in extinct_animals
# so they accurately reflect what year the animal went extinct.
# Do not use any special built-in methods.
# ----

# 4. You've heard that the following animals might be extinct, but you're not sure.
# Check if they're included in extinct_animals, one by one:
# "Andean Cat"
# "Dodo"
# "Saiga Antelope"
# Do not use any special built-in methods.
# ----

# 5. We just found out that the Passenger Pigeon is actually not extinct!
# Remove them from extinct_animals and return the key value pair as a two item array.
# Find the built-in method that helps you accomplish this in the Ruby documentation
# for Hashes.
