#Release 0: What's in a Name
For each of the situations below, read the description of the data.  Then, select a descriptive variable name for that data.  Record your variable name by replacing the <???> with the values.

1.  The local roller skating rink requires children under the age of 13 to be accompanied by a guardian.  Anyone whose age is 13 and up can enter unsupervised.

  `<???> = 13`

# Release 1: Variable Assignment
For each code snippet, read through the code. Determine what you expect each variable's value to be at the end of the snippet. Record your expectations. Then, run the code snippet in IRB and record the actual value of the variables.  Record the expected and actual values by replacing the <???>.


1.  Code snippet:

  ```
  miles_per_hour = 60
  
  miles_per_hour
  ```
  
  I expect the value of `miles_per_hour` to be ... `<???>`.  
  In IRB, the actual value of `miles_per_hour` is ... `<???>`.


2.  Code snippet:

  ```
  kilograms = 95
  kilograms = 90
  
  kilograms
  ```
  
  I expect the value of `kilograms` to be ... `<???>`.  
  In IRB, the actual value of `kilograms` is ... `<???>`.

  ```
  seat_count = 50
  sold_ticket_count = 20
  unsold_ticket_count = seat_count - sold_ticket_count
  
  seat_count
  sold_ticket_count
  unsold_ticket_count
  ```
  
  I expect the value of `seat_count` to be ... `<???>`.  
  In IRB, the actual value of `seat_count` is ... `<???>`.
  
  I expect the value of `sold_ticket_count` to be ... `<???>`.  
  In IRB, the actual value of `sold_ticket_count` is ... `<???>`.
  
  I expect the value of `unsold_ticket_count` to be ... `<???>`.  
  In IRB, the actual value of `unsold_ticket_count` is ... `<???>`.
  

4.  Code snippet:

  ```
  age = 28
  age = age + 1
  
  age
  ```
  I expect the value of `age` to be ... `<???>`.  
  In IRB, the actual value of `age` is ... `<???>`.
  
  
5.  Code Snippet:

  ```
  first_name = "Kim"
  first_name.upcase
  greeting = "Hello, " + first_name
